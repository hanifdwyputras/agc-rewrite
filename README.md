## introduction
It's just maintained `agc` library for SEO thing. What's different with original version? The orginal version is too old (only support PHP v5, and using outdated/deprecated methods and dependencies), and now you can use this library/framework with >=PHP7.x and enjoy the latest dependencies, and methods. You should not use old PHP version (under ~PHP v7.x)
